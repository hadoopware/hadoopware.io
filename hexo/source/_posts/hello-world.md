Welcome to [Hadoopware](https://hadoopware.io/) Project! We have started it in 2014 as an internal project to develop a toolchain for managing Hadoop applications when the company was transforming itself to a Hadoop technologies. We have designed the system closely to the development process within BigData Engineering group relying solely on existing Hadoop engines and avoiding any proprietory runtime thus our platform can simultaneously manage Hadoop application both on [Clouder](https://cloudera.com) and [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com) Hadoop Distributions. Project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/att/hadoopware).
